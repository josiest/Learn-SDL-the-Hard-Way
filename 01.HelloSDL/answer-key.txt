hello.cpp
=========

1) SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO | SDL_INIT_AUDIO | SDL_INIT_GAMEPAD)
2) Use SDL_SetWindowPosition with SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED

3.a) SDL allocates resources when its subsystems are initialized.
     These resources always need to be deallocated to prevent a memory leak.

3.b) Memory leak! Both of these calls are deallocating resources that are not automatically deallocated.

CMakeLists.txt
==============

1.a) cmake's find_package function may use two different search procedures: Module or Config. Module mode looks for
     Find<PackageName>.cmake while Config mode searches for <PackageName>Config.cmake. Find<PackageName>.cmake are
     usually third party scripts written to find libraries that weren't built with cmake in mind.

1.b) Yes! The source code has a cmake folder at the root level where it defines its own cmake package. In particular
     notice that there's an SDL3Config.cmake.in file. CMake will use this as a template to

1.c) Because SDL defines its own cmake package, we can tell find_package to skip module mode by specifying the CONFIG
     argument

2) The first REQUIRED keyword specified that we need the SDL3 package in order to compile this program. However, the
   SDL3 package is composed of modular components that we can choose to include or exclude. We must include the core
   component which is also called SDL3, so we pass in REQUIRED COMPONENTS SDL3.
